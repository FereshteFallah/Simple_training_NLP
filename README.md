# Roadmap for Learning NLP

## 1. Fundamentals Before NLP:

✅ Familiarity with Python  
✅ Basic understanding of Machine Learning (ML)  
(Such as regression models, classification, and basic algorithms)

## 2. Starting NLP:

Familiarity with basic concepts like:
- **Tokenization** (dividing text into words or sentences)
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**
- **Stop Words** (common words like "from," "to," "and," etc.)
- **POS Tagging** (detecting parts of speech such as verb, noun, etc.)

✅ **Tools:**
- **nltk** and **spaCy** (Great for beginners)
- Example: Extracting keywords from text

## 3. Text Analysis and Word Vectors:

- **Bag of Words**
- **TF-IDF**
- **Word Embeddings** (like Word2Vec or GloVe)

## 4. Classic NLP Models:

- **Naive Bayes** for text classification
- **Logistic Regression**
- **SVM**

## 5. Modern NLP (Deep Learning):

- Using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**
- **RNN** and **LSTM** for sequence analysis
- **Transformer** models like **BERT** and **GPT**
